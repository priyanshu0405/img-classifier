# img-classifier

This is an image classification model made using deep learning concepts. The model uses custom data for training and testing. The model has been trained and tested on Google colab, so for traing model on terminal or jupyter notebook change the path (from where dataset is being fetched) accordingly. The model also helps in visualizing the CNN layers by plotting the images after consecutive convolutional layers and the storing the pixel data in list of arrays.
